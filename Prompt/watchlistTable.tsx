Create /components/WatchlistTable.tsx as a functional component. It should:

    - Install and use the ShadCN table component UI.
- Render a table using WATCHLIST_TABLE_HEADER as the header columns with sample table data that are text-aligned left.
- Include no function handlers and no type definitions.
- Keep the code clean, minimal, and fully self-contained in WatchlistTable.tsx.
